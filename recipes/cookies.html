        <p>Making bakery-worthy chocolate chip cookies is much easier than it seems. You'll find
            a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but
            let's go over the basics:</p>

        <!-- Ingredients -->
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>These are the kitchen staples you'll need to make the best chocolate chip cookies
            of your life:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Butter:</strong> This classic chocolate chip cookie recipe starts with
                two sticks of butter creamed with white and brown sugars. The blend of sugars
                creates a perfectly balanced flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Eggs add moisture and act as a binding agent, which
                means they help hold the dough together.</li>
            <li><strong>Vanilla:</strong> Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of
                the chocolate chip cookies.</li>
            <li><strong>Baking Soda:</strong> Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it
                helps the cookies rise.</li>
            <li><strong>Water:</strong> A bit of hot water creates steam as it bakes, working
                with the baking soda to puff the cookies up.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt:</strong> A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other
                ingredients, but it won't make the cookies taste salty.</li>
            <li><strong>Flour:</strong> All-purpose flour helps create gluten, which adds
                structure to the cookie dough.</li>
            <li><strong>Chocolate Chips:</strong> Of course, you'll need semisweet chocolate
                chips! You can use dark or milk chocolate chips if you prefer.</li>
            <li><strong>Nuts (optional):</strong> Walnuts are optional, but they add nutty
                flavor and a welcome crunch.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Steps -->
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make chocolate chip
            cookies from-scratch:</p>

            <li>Dissolve the baking soda in hot water and add to the mixture.</li>
            <li>Stir in the flour, chocolate chips, and walnuts.</li>
