# odin-recipes
The Recipes project from TOP

This is the first project from The Odin Project.
It consists of a basic website written in HTML that contains
several pages of recipes.

This is only meant to practice the things I've learned so far and none of the content is original.

All of the content in these pages come from allrecipes and can be found by following these links:
